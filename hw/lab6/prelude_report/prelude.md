# Unmeasured Preludes

According to Moroney^3^, Couperin's unmeasured preludes are separated
into two main categories: (1) toccata and (2) tombeau-allemande. Both
styles share the quality of being rhythmically free. This freedom, in
addition to the lack of measure lines, causes confusion in performing
the pieces. While all note values in the score being the same, heavy
use of slurs in the score can guide the performer in determining
how to (1) sustain notes, (2) group together a series of notes, and (3)
isolate notes from what precedes and follows.

- Sustaining Notes
    - Notes forming a chord usually are sustained throughout the slurs.
    Such notes are easy to recognize as they will not usually appear
    to be runs or scales, but arppegiation of scales. At times, notes
    not belonging in chords will appear between chord tones. These passing
    notes can be placed on weak beats.

- Grouping Notes
    - Slurs over a series of notes can also indicate some ornamental 
      significance or some melodic idea.

- Isolating Notes
    - There were no examples of this in the G minor prelude...
