# Writing Fugue Subjects and Answers

The following items should be considered when writing a fugue subject

1. Shape of subject
    - the subject should have a peak and follow best practices of
      single-line melody-writing.

2. Scale degrees used
    - A common reduction of fugue subjects is
      > 5 6 5 4 3 (2 1)
      with the parenthesis indicates that the final `2 1` are optional.

3. Invertible Counterpoint
    - Note, some fugue subjects are more amenable to invertible
      counterpoint and employment of counter-subjects
    - For example, subjects starting and ending on 1 are difficult
      to yield invertible counterpoint because the answer starts on 5.
      This results in an interval of 5 (which is considered dissonant
      in traditional baroque counterpoint).
    - Also, intervals and 4 implies either a IV<sup>64</sup> or I 
      with an unresolved sus. Hence, intervals of 4 are considered
      dissonant, and non-invertible in traditional academic counterpoint.
    - Use of dissonance like 2, 7 intervals are great on non-strong beats
      or as appagiaturas, though. Often, they can be inverted gracefully.

4. Establishment of the home key early on
    - This almost always implies playing the tonic early on.
      As an **academic practice**, the tonic should always be in the 
      subject, and the `I` chord should be the first to be formed.

5. The implied answer (real or tonal)
    - Answers are real if they are an exact transposition
    - Answers are tonal if they are no real
    - Usually, the subject will begin and end in the home key,
      and answers should be in the dominant but keep the previous
      chord and quickly transition to the dominant. Hence adjustments
      at the beginning of the answer need to be made (tonal answer).

6. Answer (Usually) in Dominant
    - The answer is usually in the dominant because it can be real
      most easily.
    - But answers can be in the subdominant! 
      (or any transposition as long as it is successful)
      See the G minor violin Sonata (Fugue) by Bach. The answer is in 
      subdominant.
